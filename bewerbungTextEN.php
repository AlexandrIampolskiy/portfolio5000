<p>Dear Sirs and Madames,</p>
<br>
<p>I would like to complete a six-month internship as an IT specialist for application development in your company. I could start the internship on November 22nd, 2021.</p>
<br>
<p>Independent work, creativity and logical thinking are my strengths. I am resilient and have no problem working under pressure.</p>
<p>Team spirit, adherence to deadlines and committed work are important to me. My working style is thorough, determined and quality conscious.</p>
<br>
<p>Since August 2020 I have been taking part in a retraining course to become an IT specialist for software development at Damago GmbH in Berlin.</p>
<p>The retraining takes two years, is a lot of fun and enriches my personal interest with technical expertise. I am interested in mobile web applications, databases, automation and the design and architecture of various "back-end solutions" for web applications.</p>
<br>
<p>I look forward to positive feedback from you and the opportunity to introduce myself to you personally.</p>
<br>
<p>With best regards</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Alexandr Iampolskaia</p>
